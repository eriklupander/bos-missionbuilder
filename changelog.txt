* Vehicle groups command to use follow roads formation nows works
* Formation calculations for LINE, COLUMN and VEE now works
* Air units always spawn in VEE formation with > 100 meters between each aircraft. Seems to reduce collisions a lot.
* Air units try to form loose VEE formation 13 seconds after mission start (not 100% sure this actually works)
* Fixed broken map filters for Air, Ground and static objects
* Added map filter to show both sides at the same time
* Fixed bug where Select Country menu option was not visible after creating a new mission
* Vehicle formation select now only shows ground unit formations.
* Briefing icons now always shows BLUE for friendly forces and RED for enemies
* Fixed bug with wrong icons shown for various ground objects

Known/new issues:
* Aircraft groups in mission briefing uses Baloon icon. Havn't figured out the IconId for planes yet...
* Waypoint select bug. New waypoints are not selectable until another unit has been selected and then deselected.
* All other known ones, see initial post...

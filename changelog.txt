* Added Flight Manager, which replaces the Skin Manager. Allows AI level to be set for individual planes as well as skins. Will also add Loadouts to this view later on. Please note that I have locked the currently selected player plane for now in order to not make things over-complicated syncing this view with the controls in the Edit Flight form.
* Added all ground vehicles present in the FME to SMB
* Added thumbnail images for all ground vehicles (should help people figure out what a "61K" or "BA10M" is). Note - uses the preview images from within the BoS data/graphics/preview folder so if your application.properties file does not point at the correct folder you won't see any images (and export etc won't work)
* Added "effects". There are five different smokes and fires to choose from. IMPORTANT: I recommend using these sparingly since you must figure out the exact altitude for the effect somehow. SMB does not have access to any altitude data (height maps etc) from the game so I can't automatically make an effect appear exactly at ground level. For planes, vehicles etc. the simulator places them on ground level automatically but effects will appear at the altitude specified - be it underground or high up in the air.

* Added Skin Manager, allowing user-made skins to be set on individual aircraft.
* Added Priority (1-3) to waypoints and commands.
* Added Delete Mission option to Menu. Deletes mission from internal SMB database. Any generated .Mission file is not deleted.
* Re-added precipitation controls to weather editor
* Added automatic append of backslash to bos.data.directory property if missing.
* Fixed bug resulting in Static Objects being placed at the western edge of the map.

* Added possibility to select player plane in formation. Select AI level 0. Now a new dropdown appears below "AI Level" where the player can select from 1 -> size of flight. If size of flight is changed to a value smaller than the currently selected "Player in formation" value, the latter is automatically set to the last plane of the flight.
* Added "duration" to the ATTACK_AREA command on waypoints. 1-120 minutes.
* Added checkboxes to ATTACK_AREA command for specifying which type of targets to target: Air, Ground, Vehicles. I think "Vehicles" translate to all movable ground objects while "Ground" translates to... not sure.
* Added context-aware Command editing - the relevant form components are now shown for ATTACK_AREA, ATTACK_TARGET, COVER, LAND, START and FLY commands.
* Added validation so COVER command has a target object set
* Removed controls from Weather Editor having no effect. (Note sure yet whether temperature does anything. I do think turbulence works)
* Fixed bug where all AI flights got AI level 2.
* Fixed bug where unit having no waypoints caused export to .Mission format to crash

IMPORTANT HAPPY NOTE 1: As per game version 1.09 it is no longer necessary to run user-made missions in Offline Mode
IMPORTANT HAPPY NOTE 2: Per the above, unlocks seems to work fine in user-made missions

* Vehicle groups command to use follow roads formation nows works
* Formation calculations for LINE, COLUMN and VEE now works
* Air units always spawn in VEE formation with > 100 meters between each aircraft. Seems to reduce collisions a lot.
* Air units try to form loose VEE formation 13 seconds after mission start (not 100% sure this actually works)
* Fixed broken map filters for Air, Ground and static objects
* Added map filter to show both sides at the same time
* Fixed bug where Select Country menu option was not visible after creating a new mission
* Vehicle formation select now only shows ground unit formations.
* Briefing icons now always shows BLUE for friendly forces and RED for enemies
* Fixed bug with wrong icons shown for various ground objects

Known/new issues:
* Aircraft groups in mission briefing uses Baloon icon. Havn't figured out the IconId for planes yet...
* All other known ones, see initial post...
